## Dependencies
- Updated Paper to 1.21.5

## Note: This is a patch release
Due to the nature of how releases on GitHub work, patch releases are only published on Modrinth.

## Note: Incompatibilities
Because of the many changes made to Paper, this version of the Axios plugin is no longer compatible with Minecraft 1.21.4 and below. Please use the respective versions on Modrinth. The API is unaffected.
