## For server owners

If a plugin you use requires Axios, just download the needed version from here ~~or [GitHub](https://github.com/Loapu/Axios/releases)~~ and put it inside your plugins' folder.

## For developers

Axios provides basic functionality for paper plugins like:

* An API for creating and managing plugin settings/configuration.
* An API for managing messages, localization, and placeholders via [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/index.html).
* A hook into [CommandAPI](https://commandapi.jorel.dev) allowing the use of it through Axios, however with no requirement to do so.

Documentation on how to use that API can be found [here](https://docs.axios.software/) in the ~~near~~ far future.

**IMPORTANT:** Do not use the Axios Paper plugin for your development. Axios has an API that can be imported via Maven or Gradle and is registered as a service on Paper.
